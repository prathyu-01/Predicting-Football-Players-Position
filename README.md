# Predicting-Football-Players-Position
The problem of predicting a football player’s suitable position has been
tackled with the binary relevance technique ( Multi-label ) and random forest. The technique has
been tested and found to be giving more accurate results. 14 Different positions were identified and
using them 14 models were created and trained as a part of the binary relevance technique. Rather
than using the scored based analysis here player’s skill data is used to predict the player’s suitable position
